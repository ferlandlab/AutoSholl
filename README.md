# AutoSholl
ImageJ plugin: performs morphometric analyses of structures with branching morphologies (e.g., neuronal dendritic spines, vascular morphology, and primary cilia) using BranchAnalysis2D/3D and adds functionality for Sholl Analysis with AutoSholl.

The compiled version of this algorithm is located under the folder Fiji.app. Sample data sets are also provided in a separate folder labelled dataSets. Instructions on how to use the algorithm is present in the file readme.pdf. Both BranchAnalysis2D/3D and AutoSholl are available for download in this version.

Source code is in the folder sourceCode.
